### 🌟 Tech Stack
- Python: Data extraction and EDA
- Power Query: Minor data adjustments
- Power Bi: Dashboard creation and data presentation
- PyCharm: Used PyCharm as IDE
- Algorithm Complexity: Developing a recommendation algorithm that considers multiple factors while ensuring scalability and real-time performance was challenging.

### 💡Insights Derived
- Personalized Recommendations: The recommendation model provides personalized restaurant suggestions based on user preferences, determines the best location for opening a restaurant.
  
- Restaurant Insights: By analyzing user preferences, restaurant owners can gain insights into customer preferences, leading to menu optimization and targeted promotions.

### 🚀 Future Scope
- User Feedback Loop: Implement a feedback mechanism to capture user preferences and continuously update the recommendation model.

- Geo-Location Integration: Integrate real-time location data to recommend nearby restaurants and delivery options

- Market Expansion: Extend the recommendation system to other cities and regions to reach a broader user base.
